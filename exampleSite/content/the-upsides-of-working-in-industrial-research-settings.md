Academic research can be very satisfying for a lot of folks involved in it. All those late-night lab visits combined with a group of people sharing similar interests as yours can be a very stimulating experience you can have ever. While there can be numerous perks of academia, it doesn't come up without its downsides, some of which I will not get into in this article. I will focus more on the experience of leaving the bubble of academia and getting into the real-world industrial work environment. For many of the folks like me, being in academia can be daunting, and there is a strong urge to leave that you occasionally shove aside, hoping that things might turn up better in the future. The issues like bad academic advisors, lack of resources, and very little-incentive can very quickly take a toll on your mental health. The long hours required for the experiments can soon deteriorate your everyday social life. While you dedicated all of it and did your best to perform "great" research, the results(publications) are often more affected by your advisor's stature, funding of the project to make it work, and finally, the level of expertise of your research advisor. These are kinds of stuff that are out of your control and never anticipated to be an issue in the first place.

Nevertheless, if you decided to leave academic research based on the above factors, trust me, there are great things ahead. I also decided to leave it and move on to industry settings, few months back. I am currently working in a medical AI startup and the experience have been a perspective shift for me. I will try to describe the crucial ones here concisely.
