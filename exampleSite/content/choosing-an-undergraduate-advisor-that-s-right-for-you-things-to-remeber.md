The question of finding a right professor as advisor is so important that I decided to pen down few of my own insights about it. While many undergrads in IIT comes with a mentality to explore as much as possible, few like me want to start out early in the sport. Undergraduate research can be fruitful and rewarding experience if you are able to find an awesome advisor who can guide you, challenge you and have compassion to understand your situation as a confused undergraduate student.
